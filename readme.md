## About
This repo is all about writing some simple, single-page, [`three.js`](https://threejs.org/) samples.

[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
[[github](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)]
[[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three.js)]
is a JavaScript API that builds on WebGL, and adds a lot of support to that lower-level library.

My motivation is that I want to experiment with some 3D ideas, and for simplicity and portability reasons, I choose WebGL and three.js.

This repo, three_start, has a bunch of little demo starter sample pages.  A realistic three.js-based project would be built with multiple files.  But these demos are meant to work as stand-alone html files.
