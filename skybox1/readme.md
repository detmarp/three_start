# skybox1 textures

For [06-planets](../06-planets.html) I want a skybox that I can load from a
cloud CDN, just so I can say that page loads from a single file, without
any local resources.

Imgur is actually an amazingly cool way to stash image files in a
[CORS-friendly way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).
You don't even need an account (writing this in 2022).
You just go to [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/upload) and upload a local
image.

As of Sept 2022, I have these six skybox images in imgur.
